artifacts from building

workflows: linting (clang-tidy) + artifacts from building

cmake lint + =>

workflows: cmake linter

workflows: deploying, running tests, valgrind

travis/jenkins?

code coverage

build status (badge)

milestones

wiki?

actions/create-release

dependabot

different compiler options for different compilers

ninja instead of makefiles



style for workflows:
- should all jobs have a name(?)
- capital letter for sentences (names)
- no dot to end the names of jobs
- all names should be human readable (no dashes or other such things)
